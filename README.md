# Optimizer
A full-stack web application that optimizes order allocation across transporters in a supply chain network. It solves the source–destination problem with transporter capacity, weight, and time constraints, and provides AI-powered insights for better decision making.

🔹 Key Features

📦 Order & Transporter Management – Add, update, and track orders with weights, destinations, and transporter capacities.

⚡ Optimization Engine – Allocates orders to transporters using greedy/knapsack-based algorithms.

📊 Interactive Dashboard – Visualizes allocation with charts and custom map-based graphs.

🤖 AI Insights – Generates plain-language recommendations to improve load balancing, reduce delays, and cut costs.

📜 History Tracking – Stores past optimization runs for analysis.

☁️ Full Deployment – React frontend (Vercel) + Node/Express backend (Render/Heroku) + MongoDB Atlas.
